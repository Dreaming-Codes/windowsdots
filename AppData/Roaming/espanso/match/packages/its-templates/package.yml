      Hello,

      UCR ITS does not provide hardware support for personally owned computers. For hardware issues, I recommend:

      1. Manufacturer warranty/repair services
      2. Third-party repair shops
      3. On-campus repair services (check with your college/department)

      For software-related issues, we are happy to help!

      Hello,

      The system you mentioned is a legacy system that is no longer actively supported by ITS.

      For alternatives or workarounds, please check with your department or consider:

      1. Modern replacement systems
